# Child Detector

The Child Detector project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect the presence of a child in an image. By implementing image processing algorithms and training a model, this project aims to accurately determine whether an image contains a child or not. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and running the Child Detector model.

## Introduction

The Child Detector project focuses on accurately identifying the presence of a child in an image using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. The model developed in this project combines image processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in child detection.

## Installation

To install and set up the Child Detector project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avaneesh-Pathak /Child_Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Child_Detector
   ```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the Child Detector model:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Place the images you want to analyze in the `images` directory within the project folder.
3. Run the `child_detector.py` script:
   ```
   python child_detector.py
   ```
4. The script will process the images and determine whether each image contains a child or not.
5. The results, indicating the presence or absence of a child in each image, will be displayed or saved depending on the script implementation.

## Model Training

If you are interested in training the Child Detector model using your own dataset or improving the existing model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset of images with corresponding child or non-child labels.
2. Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your requirements.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and make any necessary adjustments to improve accuracy.

## Dataset

The Child Detector model requires a labeled dataset of images with corresponding child or non-child labels. Ensure that your dataset contains a diverse set of images with and without children to achieve accurate predictions.

If you don't have a dataset, you can utilize publicly available image datasets or create your own by collecting and labeling images.

## Results

The Child Detector model will provide results based on the analysis of the provided images. The results may include the following:

- Detection of a child in the input images
- Classification output indicating the presence or absence of a child
- Confidence levels or probabilities associated with the classification output

Please review the output carefully and assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
